  \section*{Part 1}
  \subsubsection*{1. Give examples of two different kinds of errors in the output}
  The first type of error that is seen in the output relate to ``S'' phonemes. For example, ``AE D + M IH + N AH S + T ER + IH NG'' was mispared as ``AE D + M IH + N AH + S T ER + IH NG''.
  \br
  The second type of error that is seen relates to ``ly'' endings. For example, ``AH + SH UH + R AH D + L IY'' was misparsed as ``AH + SH UH + R AH + D L IY''.

  \subsubsection*{2. Why do these errors happen?}


  \subsubsection*{3. How could the syllabification program be improved to fix these errors?}
